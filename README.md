# Quotes App
Welcome to my Quotes App! This project showcases my ability to build a functional and visually appealing Android application using Kotlin, Retrofit, and Coroutine for network operations. The app fetches quotes from an API and displays them with corresponding images from Unsplash.

# Key Features
1. **Retrofit Integration**: 
   Utilized Retrofit to handle API calls for fetching quotes and images. Retrofit simplifies network requests and allows for easy handling of API responses.

2. **Coroutines for Asynchronous Operations**: 
   The app uses Kotlin Coroutines to manage background tasks. Coroutines help in performing network operations off the main thread, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

3. **RecyclerView Integration**: 
   I used RecyclerView to display a list of quotes and images. This allows for efficient display and scrolling of large datasets, enhancing the app's performance and user experience.

4. **Glide for Image Loading**: 
   The app uses Glide to load images from URLs. Glide is efficient in handling image loading and caching, which helps in smooth image rendering and better performance.

5. **Logging Interceptor**: 
   I implemented an HTTP Logging Interceptor to log network requests and responses. This is useful for debugging and ensures that the network operations are transparent and traceable.


# Conclusion
This Quotes App demonstrates my ability to build a functional and responsive Android application with dynamic content fetched from APIs. It emphasizes network operations using Retrofit, asynchronous tasks using Coroutines, and a clean user interface with efficient image loading. I enjoyed working on this project and hope it serves as a useful tool and learning resource for others.
